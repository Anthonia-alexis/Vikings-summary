    <h2>
        <p> I have just recently completed this series called <i> Vikings. </i>
            <br> Vikings is inspired by the sagas of <b> Ragnar Lodbrok, </b> a Viking who is one of the best-known
            legendary Norse heroes and
            notorious as the scourge of Anglo-Saxon England and West Francia. The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer from
            the Kattegat
            who rises to fame by raiding England and eventually becomes a Scandinavian king, with the support of his
            family and
            fellow warriors. In the later seasons, the series follows the fortunes of his sons and their adventures in
            England,
            Scandinavia, Kievan Rus', the Mediterranean and North America.

        <br> They have a son called, Bjorn, who is extremely eager
        to join his father in raiding, but the young boy is only 13 years as at the time season 1 starts.
        Ragnar has a brother called, Rollo, who betrays him several times, despite that, <I> Ragnar</I> kept forgiving
        him.</p>
        <h2> As the series progresses, we see Ragnar raiding distant lands and coming back to tgheir home town in Norway
            called <i> Kattegat. </i> <br>
